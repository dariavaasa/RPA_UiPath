The robot
- copies profile activity data
- analyses it in Excel
- finds active users
- scrapes data about those users, analyses this data in Excel
- scrapes additional data about those users, analyses this as well and then
- compiles and sends an email with results: who would be the most suitable users for my audience.

Usually, I run this robot when a promotion campaign active.
Length of the process is 3:30 min.
The robot expects that I am already logged on all websites.
It took me around one week to build it. 
The robot is built on a vitual machine - that's why the video/process runs a bit slow.
